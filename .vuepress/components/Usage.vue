        * You should now be able to use it like you would regularly use Socialite (assuming you have the facade installed):

        ```php
        return Socialite::with('{{ socialiteName }}')->redirect();
        ```

        ### Lumen Support

        You can use Socialite providers with Lumen.  Just make sure that you have facade support turned on and that you follow the setup directions properly.

        **Note:** If you are using this with Lumen, all providers will automatically be stateless since **Lumen** does not keep track of state.

        Also, configs cannot be parsed from the `services[]` in Lumen.  You can only set the values in the `.env` file as shown exactly in this document.  If needed, you can
          also override a config (shown below).


        ### Stateless

        * You can set whether or not you want to use the provider as stateless.  Remember that the OAuth provider (Twitter, Tumblr, etc) must support whatever option you choose.

        **Note:** If you are using this with Lumen, all providers will automatically be stateless since **Lumen** does not keep track of state.

        ```php
        // to turn off stateless
        return Socialite::with('{{ socialiteName }}')->stateless(false)->redirect();

        // to use stateless
        return Socialite::with('{{ socialiteName }}')->stateless()->redirect();
        ```


        ### Overriding a config

        If you need to override the provider's environment or config variables dynamically anywhere in your application, you may use the following:

        ```php
        $clientId = "secret";
        $clientSecret = "secret";
        $redirectUrl = "http://yourdomain.com/api/redirect";
        $additionalProviderConfig = ['site' => 'meta.stackoverflow.com'];
        $config = new \SocialiteProviders\Manager\Config($clientId, $clientSecret, $redirectUrl, $additionalProviderConfig);
        return Socialite::with('{{ socialiteName }}')->setConfig($config)->redirect();
        ```

        ### Retrieving the Access Token Response Body

        Laravel Socialite by default only allows access to the `access_token`.  Which can be accessed
        via the `\Laravel\Socialite\User->token` public property.  Sometimes you need access to the whole response body which
        may contain items such as a `refresh_token`.

        You can get the access token response body, after you called the `user()` method in Socialite, by accessing the property `$user->accessTokenResponseBody`;

        ```php
        $user = Socialite::driver('{{ socialiteName }}')->user();
        $accessTokenResponseBody = $user->accessTokenResponseBody;
        ```

        {{ socialiteName }}
