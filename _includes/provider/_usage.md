* You should now be able to use it like you would regularly use Socialite (assuming you have the facade installed):

```php
return Socialite::with('{{ name | downcase | remove: '.' }}')->redirect();
```

### Lumen Support

You can use Socialite providers with Lumen.  Just make sure that you have facade support turned on and that you follow the setup directions properly.

**Note:** If you are using this with Lumen, all providers will automatically be stateless since **Lumen** does not keep track of state.

Also, configs cannot be parsed from the `services[]` in Lumen.  You can only set the values in the `.env` file as shown exactly in this document.  If needed, you can
  also override a config (shown below).


### Stateless

* You can set whether or not you want to use the provider as stateless.  Remember that the OAuth provider (Twitter, Tumblr, etc) must support whatever option you choose.

**Note:** If you are using this with Lumen, all providers will automatically be stateless since **Lumen** does not keep track of state.

```php
// to turn off stateless
return Socialite::with('{{ name | downcase | remove: '.' }}')->stateless(false)->redirect();

// to use stateless
return Socialite::with('{{ name | downcase | remove: '.' }}')->stateless()->redirect();
```


### Overriding a config

If you need to override the provider's environment or config variables dynamically anywhere in your application, you may use the following:

```php
$clientId = "secret";
$clientSecret = "secret";
$redirectUrl = "http://yourdomain.com/api/redirect";
$additionalProviderConfig = ['site' => 'meta.stackoverflow.com'];
$config = new \SocialiteProviders\Manager\Config($clientId, $clientSecret, $redirectUrl, $additionalProviderConfig);
return Socialite::with('{{ name | downcase | remove: '.' }}')->setConfig($config)->redirect();
```

### Retrieving the Access Token Response Body

Laravel Socialite by default only allows access to the `access_token`.  Which can be accessed
via the `\Laravel\Socialite\User->token` public property.  Sometimes you need access to the whole response body which
may contain items such as a `refresh_token`.

You can get the access token response body, after you called the `user()` method in Socialite, by accessing the property `$user->accessTokenResponseBody`;

```php
$user = Socialite::driver('github')->user();
$accessTokenResponseBody = $user->accessTokenResponseBody;
```
